Boop -- Decipher the diaper!
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

Boop is a simple app that allows the user to input information about a baby's dirty diaper and retrieve analysis as to the baby's health.

The user may input data by: 
* Selecting the diaper color from a collection of Swatches
